                            Our users want to donate to charity, but have a lack of knowledge on the charities themselves and unsure of how to start donating. Our solution will provide users with a way to easily find and learn about the charities that they are interested in, and have payment options that would work for them.

                            My team and I created sketched on what our donations app could look like! We then met up, showed our ideas and created our ideal sketch on what our app can look like!

                        <p>
                        Based on our final sketch as a group, I created a paper prototype on what the app would look like detailed. I couldnt make it a video like the examples because my microphone on my phone didn't work, so I made it on google slides and wrote out what would happen.

                        <p>
                        We got customer feedback by having other people outside of team to use our paper prototype to naviaget our app and see how easy it is to someone completely new to the concept. We then asked them what they liked and what we should change and we documented it.
